# MSA tool for Proteus AI

Hello! This is the MSA_tool project, where I will be developing the MSA module for the
ProteusAI tool developed by @Jonfunk21. The purpose of this project is to design a data pipeline for producing MSA's. This program should recieve as Input a FASTA protein file and outputs an MSA with its respective family protein ID and which conerved residues from this MSA are conserved within the input.

## Supported OS(Operating Systems)
This MSA tool has been tested using Ubuntu 22.04 and MacOS 10.13.6 High sierra. It should therfore work in any linux-based system that has Python installed(Normally built in).

## Dependencies
